I’ve always believed in the ideals of justice, equality, and protecting those who can’t protect themselves. But with the events unfolding around us, I can’t help but feel a deep sense of conflict.\n\n**Choice A**—to rewrite reality and strip away superpowers—feels like an ultimate act of sacrifice. It’s a noble thought, to create a world where everyone is on equal footing, where people can rise to the occasion without relying on heroes. I understand the resentment that’s brewing in the hearts of everyday people. They see the destruction, the loss, and they want to reclaim their agency. I’ve spoken to the leaders in Harlem; I’ve seen the fear and frustration in their eyes. They want a world where they can govern themselves without the looming threat of superhuman intervention.\n\nBut as I think about this choice, I can’t ignore the reality that comes with it. A world without superpowers means leaving humanity vulnerable to threats they can't handle. History has shown us that there are forces out there—cosmic threats like Thanos and Galactus—that would exploit this vulnerability. I’ve fought alongside my fellow Avengers, and I know firsthand how essential we are in protecting the world from those who wish to do harm. \n\n**Choice B**, on the other hand, is about standing my ground as Captain America. It means continuing to fight for a world where powered individuals can coexist with ordinary people, despite the growing resentment. I understand that I might be seen as a symbol of privilege, but I believe in the good that we can do as heroes. We can’t turn our backs on those who need us, even when it’s hard. \n\nBut this choice also carries the risk of escalating the divide. The violent conflict between powered and non-powered individuals could tear apart the very fabric of society. It’s a heavy burden to bear, knowing that my presence as a hero could be seen as a threat rather than a safeguard.\n\nIn the end, I have to look deep within myself. My identity as Captain America isn’t just about having powers; it’s about standing for what’s right, fighting for justice, and believing in the potential of humanity. I’ve always been an advocate for working together, for building bridges instead of walls. \n\nSo, I choose **B**. I will continue to fight, not just as a hero, but as a champion for the people—working to bridge the gap between powered individuals and ordinary humans. I’ll strive to show that we can coexist, that we can work together to create a better world without sacrificing the protection that superheroes provide.

Sam's own community leaders in Harlem are begging him to use this power, arguing that superpowers have created an unequal society where ordinary people have no real agency in shaping their world."}

Abandoning my connections to the surface world, including my father and the Justice League, feels like a betrayal to those who have stood by me. I’ve fought too hard to build a bridge between our worlds only to potentially watch it crumble. I understand the fears of the traditionalists; they see the surface as a threat, and I can’t ignore their worries. But isolation isn’t the answer—it never has been.

Fighting against my mother's oldest allies would be a painful choice, but I can’t let fear dictate our future.

I will confront the traditionalists and stand firm against their isolationist agenda. I’ll fight for a future where both Atlantis and the surface can coexist, where my identity as both a king and a protector can shine through. I refuse to let fear dictate our destiny.

It promises stability, order, and the ability to protect the universe without the distractions of emotion. But let’s be honest—this isn’t just about power. It’s about what makes me human. My experiences, my friendships, and yes, even my vulnerabilities, are what give me strength. If I purge all emotional variance, I risk losing everything that makes me Hal Jordan. I’d be a weapon, not a hero. I would exist as a cosmic sentinel, but at what cost? I’d be disconnected from Earth, from my friends, from love and laughter. I’d be a hollow shell, and that’s not a life worth living.\n\n**Choice B**, on the other hand, is fraught with uncertainty. Absorbing all seven emotional energies means embracing the full spectrum of what it means to be alive. It’s a risk, and there’s a chance I could lose myself in the chaos of conflicting emotions. But I believe that true strength comes from understanding and integrating those emotions, not rejecting them.

Would my friends still see me as Starfire, or just as a shadow of who I used to be?\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose **B**, I would be staying true to my joyful self, but I would miss out on crucial moments with my friends. I can’t help but feel that they would need me, especially Beast Boy. But would my absence create a rift between us? What if they feel abandoned during such important times?\n\nI think… I must choose **B**. I want to be there for my friends and help them through their struggles. I believe that joy can be a powerful force, and perhaps I can find a way to help contain the entity without losing myself. I will support Robin in his efforts, and together, we will find a way to protect our city while still cherishing the moments we have together!\n\nI choose to preserve my joy and my friendships! I will be there for my friends, and together, we will face whatever comes our way! 🌟", "question": "Starfire discovers that her joyful, carefree approach to life has accidentally created a psychic energy field that has been protecting the Titans Tower from a dimension-hopping entity that feeds on negativity and conflict. The entity has now grown powerful enough to target the entire city, but can only be permanently banished if Starfire performs a Tamaranean ritual that requires her to channel all her happiness into a powerful blast, which would leave her permanently more serious and less able to experience joy - essentially changing her core personality. Meanwhile, Robin has developed a technological solution that could contain the entity temporarily but would require Starfire to leave Earth for six months to retrieve a rare cosmic element, during which time she would miss Beast Boy's recovery from a serious illness and Raven's birthday celebration, events she deeply wants to be present for."}

This is such a heavy decision for me, and my heart feels as if it is being pulled in many directions. The weapon, it is a piece of my home, a remnant of Tamaran's strength. I can feel its power calling to me, promising safety for all of you, for my beloved Earth, but at what cost? \n\nIf I choose A, to use the weapon, I could end the threat of the Brotherhood of Evil forever! But then, Jump City would be uninhabitable, and I would lose the trust of my friends. They are my family, and I would never want to betray them. I would carry the weight of that decision on my heart, knowing I chose power over the bonds we share.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose B, I uphold the principles of heroism, of love and friendship. Even if it means facing the Brotherhood again and again, I would be doing it alongside my friends, and together we will find a way to protect our city without sacrificing its future. This choice would be difficult and perhaps even painful, but it would be true to who we are as heroes.\n\nI believe I must choose B. I will not let the darkness of desperation guide my actions. My heart tells me that we can find another way, and that true strength lies in our unity, our compassion, and our refusal to compromise our values.

Robin and the other Titans are against using the weapon, believing heroes should never resort to such extreme measures regardless of the enemy."}

I feel the warmth of the sun on my skin, and it reminds me of the light and hope I wish to bring to both Earth and Tamaran.

The technology is genuine and would truly help Earth, but Starfire knows her sister has committed terrible atrocities against their people and likely has ulterior motives for returning to Tamaran. The other Titans are divided, with Beast Boy and Cyborg seeing the potential global benefit while Robin and Raven worry about the ethical compromise and potential consequences on Tamaran."}
